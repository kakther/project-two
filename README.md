# Version Notes
The version of this app currently uploaded is 1.0.0. In cases where I update the README without any updates to the website itself I do not update the version number or use branches for my work. Each version number will lack a commit number until the next version is uploaded. The commit number is always added retroactively as it's generated at the time that I commit the project. In general, for version number format X.Y.Z:
